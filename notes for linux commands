nano - opens or creates a new file 
ex: nano first.s
.s, .as, .asm - accepted file format in asm

nasm -f elf -o first.o first.s 
nasm - calling Netwide Assembler (NASM) tool to compile assembly language
-f elf - elf (executable and linkable format) ensures the output object is compatible with the ELF format
-o first.o - specifies the output file (in this case, first.o) that NASM will generate
first.s - specirfies the input file (source file) that I want to assemble

ld -m elf_i386 -o first first.o
ld - GNU linker command, combines one or more object files generated by an assembler / compiler (first.o) into a single executable file
-m elf_i386 - specifies the target architecture and format for the output file (crucial when working with assembly code intended for specific hardware)
i386 - 32 bit Intel architecture 
-o first - specifies the output file name (in this case, first is the name of the final executable file that the linker will produce)

ls - list the contents of a directory

Debugging:
Method 1:
./first 
echo $? - output may vary, if ebx is set to 1 then it will be 1

Method 2:
gdb first
under gdb
layout asm - put you in assembly mode debugger
break _start - creating break point at _start
run - starts the breakpoint (it will stop at the breakpoint)
stepi - increment 1 instruction forward (moving to one instruction in reference to the breakpoint)
info registers eax - shows what value/data is assigned to eax (can be 0 or 1, eax should be 1 as we already moved to the instruction MOV EAX,1)
info registers ebx - shows what value/data is assigned to ebx (can be 0 or 1, but for first.s file, ebx should be 0 first as we did not move on another instruction)


sudo apt-get update - updates to newest version of packages and their dependencies
sudo apt-get install gdb - installs GNU Debugger (debugs C, C++, Fortran, Assembly Language)
