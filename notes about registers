General Purpose Registers

E - extended
Each of them has 32 bits
EAX (Accumulator) - arithmetic (multiplication and division), accumulator since it accumulates results of arithmetic and logical operations 
EBX (Base) - pointer to data in data segment
ECX (Counter) - loop counter and shift/rotate operations
EDX (Data) - I/O Operations and arithmetic

(Not modifiable as they are just address pointers)
ESI (Source Index) - String operations and pointer to source data for copying/processing
EDI (Destination Index) - String operations, pointer to destination data for copying/processing (complements ESI)
EBP (Base Pointer) - Keeps track of function call parameters and local variables on the stack
ESP (Stack Pointer) - Points to the top of the stack (current stack address - useful for managing function calls, parameters, return addresses, and local variables

EIP (Instruction Pointer) - Points to the address of the next instruction
EFLAGS 
- CF (Carry) 
- OF (Overflow)
- SF (Sign)
- ZF (Zero)
- AC (Auxiliary)
- PF (Parity)

Each of them has 16 bits (almost the same function / purpose with above)
AX - arithmetic, logic, data transfer operations
BX - base pointer for data access
CX - loop counter, iterative operations
DX - I/O operations, extended arithmetic operations along AX

Each 16 bit register can be divided into halves - high and low
Each of them has 8-bit high. It holds more significant 8 bits (leftmost - 128 64 32 and so forth)
AH, BH, CH, DH
Each of them has 8-bit low. It holds less significant 8 bits (rightmost - 1 2 4 and so forth)
AL, BL, CL, DL
